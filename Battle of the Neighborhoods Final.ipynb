Coffee shops are an incredibly competitive market and with so many already around, using data science and basic economic principles to help decide location, would give this business an upper hand, relative to those without this information. I will be using the information I get on current coffee shop location data, to determine, based on Hotelling's linear city model, competitive advantage and supply and demand functions, which would be the ideal location for the coffee shop to get the highest profits. Hotelling's model essentially states that businesses with near identical products should space themselves out equidistant from one another from the radius of a given \"circular city\" (1). (There is also a horizonal city model but the circular city model more closely represents the k-clusters I will be using in my data, which will be further described below). Coffee shops should space themselves out equally to attract underserved areas and to entice customers who would be reducing travel time to go to the new coffee shop instead. Being too close to other coffee shops runs the risk of entering a price war, and would mean having to "
